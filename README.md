# 📊 Correlation Analysis with Pearson, Spearman & Kendall

This project illustrates how Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation coefficients behave under different relationships between two variables.

## Relationships Demonstrated
1. Linear (Y = X)
2. Non-linear Monotonic (Y = X³)
3. Non-linear Non-Monotonic (Y = X²)
4. Step Function
5. Sinusoidal (Y = sin(X))

Each example:
- Shows correlation metrics
- Plots the X-Y relationship

## How to Run

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
python correlation_examples.py
```

Each plot will display one-by-one. Press Enter to continue to the next.
